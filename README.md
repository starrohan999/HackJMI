# Problem statement
When the hackathon organizer organized the hackathon he follow the traditional flow way to give appreciation to all participants and mentors (Certificates are provided for participation & Achievement) and Some appreciation posts to their social media. ex: Givemycertificate
# Solution
All ways to solve that can simply be to use web3 power and decentralized storage for it. A Simple smart contract that mints NFT and airdrops to the wallet as a token of appreciation, POAs proof of attendance, and Proof of Achievement. So simply can solve it and it will be very funcky & fancy 

# Technology use
Solidity->ethereum testnet->wallet->filebase(ipfs cid){decentralized storage}->opensea testnet.
